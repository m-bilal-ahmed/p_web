### Discription
- Led a development team using Python to build a machine learning model that would **recognize and classify damaged and undamaged cars based on user provided images.** 
- Used Scikit learn and image for machine learning and image processing. Used Matplotlib and NumPy for data visualization. **Improved the accuracy of the model from 56% to 80%** using a custom data set. Drove a unit test effort to further improve accuracy of model up to 90%
- Led process to deploy the application onto Azure cloud. Used Azure cognitive services for the ML models and Azure custom vision for **improving the speed and accuracy of processing images by up to 40%.**
