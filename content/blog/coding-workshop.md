# Introduction
Fitts law: A speed and accuracy model of human movement developed from
research in a machine system for air traffic. The goal of this paper was to use this very
law and try to fit it into 2-dimensional tasks. When the authors had examine the law from
this perspective. They had to consider many different factors such as the angle at which
the target might be and so on. There were different formulas developed beforehand but
the Shannan formula was preferred for the basis of this experiment. Different factors
such as the size and shape of the model were taken into consideration when calculating
the movement time(i.e., time required to touch the target)

# What did the authors assess and find?
They assessed the time taken by the users to select a target at different angles.
Each angle and general distance were categorized into different groups. There were
twelve computer literature subjects that served as volunteers. There were 9 male and 3
female volunteers. The results from these tests were then compared. The
SMALLER-OF and W‚Äô models were very close in their movement time. While on the
other hand the SMALLER-OF vs STATUS QUO and W‚Äô vs STATUS QUO had a huge
gap in their movement time. The SMALLER-OF model highlighted that Movement time
depends upon pointing distance more as the target gets larger. An interesting
observation under the STATUS quo model was that generally, one would expect large
size letters and alphabets should have a significantly shorter time to select but then it
turns out that the results or prediction did not match this. A major observation that was
found was that it was difficult to compare these different models as in some such as W‚Äô
it was assumed that the subject moved towards the center of the target. Perhaps the
biggest factor was comparing these different models when the parameters themselves
were not the same. So the comparison did not make sense other than the final
movement time.
# Limitations of the paper
The paper itself talks about some of the limitations of the proposed models.
While some models are easier to use, such as the Status Quo model, they can lead to
inaccurate data. The other models, which account more for height and angle of
approach, can be harder to apply in a more general sense, such as the smaller-of
model being limited to rectangular objects. Notably what isn‚Äôt discussed as a limitation
with regards to their experiment, is that the sample size for the experiment is fairly
small: 12. In addition, the subjects of the study were computer-literate volunteers.
However, the volunteers' backgrounds are less of a problem since the focus of the study
was to fix Fitt‚Äôs law in two dimensions, since it could with certain configurations produce
a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù difficulty value.
# The contributions of the paper to the scientific community
This paper has a clear scientific contribution through its study of ways of
modifying Fitt‚Äôs law into a more useful form for two-dimensional environments. Since
most of our User Interfaces are two-dimensional, this is important information to know.
In addition, instead of just one model, it provides and shows the result of several models
and how accurate they are. It‚Äôs important that the fundamentals we rely on stay up to
date as technology changes, and this paper does that for Fitt‚Äôs law to bring it to two
dimensions. Work in this area should continue as User Interfaces change and grow,
such as in three-dimensional environments as Virtual and Augmented Reality devices
grow in popularity.
